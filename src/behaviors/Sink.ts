/**
 * Sink — material-flow CONSUMER definition (Plan 194 §2.2, P3).
 *
 * Authored as a `defineLibraryComponent` (`kind:'sink'`, `inert:true`) so the
 * unified-simulation surface (registry + DES hooks) covers MU destruction. ONE
 * definition, but only the `des` layer carries effect here:
 *
 *   - `des.onAccept(self, mu)` — the EVENT-DRIVEN path (private DESRunner, P5):
 *     accept and DESTROY the MU (mark it consumed), and publish
 *     `Flow.Occupied = false` so an upstream conveyor reads its successor as
 *     clear and discharges its part into the sink. Returns true (always accepts).
 *   - `continuous` — a thin, INERT pass-through marker.
 *
 * ── Why the component is inert (the double-destroy guard) ───────────────────
 *
 * The CONTINUOUS destroy driver is the engine component `RVSink`
 * (`src/core/engine/rv-sink.ts`), constructed from `rv_extras['Sink']` by the
 * scene loader and ticked by the transport manager: it marks every MU whose AABB
 * overlaps the sink's collider for removal. This behavior MUST NOT re-implement
 * that AABB consumption: if its `continuous` block also destroyed MUs, every Sink
 * asset would consume on TWO paths (engine + behavior) — a regression. So
 * `inert:true` runs setup but registers NO fixedUpdate.
 *
 * One continuous EFFECT it DOES carry (an interop convenience, NOT MU
 * destruction): it publishes `Flow.Occupied = false` for its own root once at
 * setup so an upstream conveyor that snaps into a Sink reads a clear successor and
 * discharges its line — the documented "add a Sink at the end to let the line
 * discharge" path from Conveyor.ts. This is a single signal write, not a per-tick
 * loop, and it never touches MUs.
 *
 * The behavior binds only when a placed asset's name matches `*Sink*` (the
 * BehaviorManager matches `models[]` against the GLB filename / LayoutObject
 * asset name, never against inner node names).
